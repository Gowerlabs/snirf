# Contributing to SNIRF

We actively welcome contributions from the fNIRS community.
Contributions may take many forms including suggested text changes,
highlighting areas of ambiguity, reports of incompatability, etc.
Please use the GitHub issues tracker to make your contributions,
we can then publicly work with you to merge your contribution in to the SNIRF specification.


## How to participate

We use this repository to gather feedback from the community regarding the 
["Shared Near Infrared Spectroscopy Format"](snirf_specification.md), or SNIRF specification. 


The latest version of the SNIRF specification can be found in the file named 
[snirf_specification.md](snirf_specification.md). The specification is written
in the [Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
for convenient editing and version control.

You can use a number of methods to provide your feedback to the working 
draft of this file specification, including

- [Create an "Issue"](https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf/issues)
  - This is the most recommended method to provide detailed feedback or 
    discussion. An "Issue" in github is highly versatile. One can ask a 
    question, report a bug, provide a feature request, or simply propose
    general discussions. Please use URLs or keywords to link your discussion 
    to a specific line/section/topic in the document.
  - One can browse the commit history of the specification document. If
    anyone is interested in commenting on a particular update, you can also
    comment on any of the commit page using the same method.
- [Use the snirf mailing list](http://fnirs.org/resources/software/snirf/)
  - You may send your comments to the snirf mailing list (snirf at fnirs.org). 
    Subscribers will discuss by emails, and if a motion is reached, proposals
    will be resubmitted as an Issue, and changes to the specification will be
    associated with this issue page.
